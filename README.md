TagHeart
========

An overlay-building extension for the multiplayer browser-based CTF game TagPro.  This Chrome Extension will replace the default in-game overlay with a new one which shows information about game state and also player state, with hotkeys to bring up team or player stats.

Additionally, this extension will make it easy to manage team uniforms and logos and add other smal features such as smooth zooms and automatic zooming for centered map views to replace the default stepped zooming method.

This is based off of an earlier userscript which offered more limited functionality which is currently being used at TagProTV, but this is a full rewrite.

--

The extension is limited to simple DOM manipulation for the time being without any actual communication with TagPro, as TagPro will be changing API's soon with the coming pre-release of version 3 in the near future, with promises from the developer that it will "break basically every existing mod, but will remain consistent from that point forward".

This extension is lovingly named and modelled after the wonderful GameHeart Extension mod for StarCraft 2 with permission from its creator, Ryan Schutter.
